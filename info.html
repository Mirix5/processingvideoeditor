    <div class="description">
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Processing Video Editor is an easy-to-use,
            Java-Based video editing platform that is able to take in multiple 
            video, audio, and SubRipText (srt) subtitle files and allows users 
            manipulate these along a timeline. The editor contains a few 
            basic video effects that users can pick and choose from, whether 
            itâ€™s in real-time while the video plays, or preset using the 
            timeline. PVE also allows users to set which audio clips play 
            along the timeline and create subtitle tracks to align with these 
            music and/or video clips. Users can save all loaded files and 
            effects as a project file and subtitles as srt. Project files 
            load all files used in addition to the video/audio timeline timings.
